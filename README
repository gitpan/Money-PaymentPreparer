Money-PaymentPreparer version 0.03
==================================

This module change sum (i.e. payment) to collection of bills and coins
and keep it all in one hash.
For example if you have to pay 2 persons 148$ and $52 you can't get from
bank $200. Use Money::PaymentPreparer, define bills and coins and
split this sum (148 and 52) into:

$148 = $100 + 2x$20 + $5 + $2 + $1
$52 = $50 + $2.

And now you know - you need:

100 - 1
50  - 1
20  - 2
10  - 0
5   - 1
2   - 2
1   - 1
